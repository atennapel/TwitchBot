			"Barely a scratch. You're a little faster on your feet than your daddy was.",
			"I will be the one to merge! The one to see and know everything, to rule, to rule everything...",
			"What's the rush? Take a look around. This facility is where you were born. I've arranged an appropriate fate for you through the hallway to the north. A poetic death, just a few yards away from where you were created.",
			"A cure? A cure! Do you have any idea how easy it will be for me to make a new virus? All I have to do is find a very large prime number and multiply.",
			"All right. I get the picture. You want a piece of the pie, or you're going to toss the whole pie out the window. Fair enough. You can have anything you want. How about Europe? Your own continent. Just let me complete my preparations.",
			"What do you want? Money? You can have VersaLife, the whole damn company. Power? I'll get you on Mead's cabinet. I'm serious. Just forget about that last reactor.",

			"Soon I will leave this body and death will have no meaning.",
			"No! You fool!... Helios will destroy you. I'm the only one who can merge and take control. Wait for ME! I promise you will have a place in the new order...",
			"Go ahead! Blow this place sky-high... You might get rid of ME, but you'll take down Aquinas, the power grid, the whole electronic infrastructure. Is that what you want?! Are you completely nuts?!",
			"No! Don't listen to Everett. He and the Illuminati have been afraid from the beginning, afraid of US, afraid of nano-augmentation. Consider your powers, your strength, your intelligence. You've only had a small taste. Let me finish the project. Let me bring infinite power to the human body. You will not be left behind.",

			"Being a soldier isn't just following orders, it's following those orders in the service of a higher cause. When that cause is betrayed, we're not soldiers anymore, just pieces on a chess board dying for the wrong reason.",
			"A pistol is more than adequate. Hell, I dispatched a whole platoon one time with a pocket knife.",
			"I guess it's not surprising to find a few crooks in a place protected by security procedures. The shadow of secrecy... it protects indiscriminately.",
			"In my day international peacekeepers were citizens first and soldiers second.",
			"Direct intervention is always part of the game. In my day, we were just more civilized about it.",
			"My unit killed a bunch of Afghans one time, but we weren't proud of it. In fact, our liaison at the UN went to the funeral.",
			"Let's get one thing straight: we've got our share of crooked bureaucrats -- fact -- but this is still UNATCO, and by and large the people in this building are twenty-four carat gold.",
			"There's a time and a place for security, but the legislature has to stay vigilant, or there will be abuses.",

			"You will confess, by the way. I don't like to dirty my hands with that sort of thing, but you will confess.",
			"What an expensive mistake you turned out to be. I've ordered the troops to kill you, because quite frankly I don't have the patience to wait for one of those damn killswitches to work.",
			"I'm the more advanced model, Denton. It's time for you to retire.",
			"I'll find you, Denton. I've got senses even you don't know about.",
			"You have nothing! Even if Everett succeeds, you can't synthesize enough vaccine to stop an epidemic. You need a Universal Constructor! And don't think Page Industries is going to leave one lying around for you to use, not after you blew up the one in Hong Kong.",
			"Remember that NSF prisoner I was interrogating back on Liberty Island? Guess you were bitten by the same bug. There's only one cure, you know, once you've caught the disease.",

In the end, all sins are forgiven. Even yours.",
			"There's such a thing as a compassionate conspiracy. We don't need Page's commandos, troopers, crude inventions...",

			"When government surveillance and intimidation is called \"freedom from terrorism\" or \"liberation from crime\", freedom and liberty have become words without meanings.",
			"Culture by definition a shared territory of meaning, inspires conflicts far more destructive than any other dispute over territory on the Earth's surface.",
			"The rhetoric in Washington has done more to defeat liberty than all the armies and police forces in the world.",
			"This war all around us is being fought over the very meanings of words.",

			"The checks and balances of democratic governments were invented because humans themselves realized how unfit they were to govern themselves. They needed a system, yes. An industrial age machine.",
			"Without the use of computing machines they had to arrange themselves in crude structures that formalized decision-making. A highly imperfect and unstable solution.",
